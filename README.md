# Features 

This project is a Fruit dicing game. The player has to hover on the fruits coming from the top at varying speeds to dice them and score points. Each player has 3 lives. If the player misses dicing one fruit, the life count decreases by 1. If the user misses the fruits thrice, the game is over and the total score is displayed on the screen.
